# Comfy-House-E-commerce-Project

This is a small **e-commerce website** which contains a front page and a cart section.

Run on your localhost at localhost:8080 using npm http-server command

### Things I found

- npm http-server is not available yet as you dont have a `package-lock.json` file
- left some comments in your code yea
  - shop-now button
  - dropdown for the navbar
  - navbar shop name
  - footer for contacting
- [VScode extension live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) might be the best for this project

### About npm

I think you might have it on your local, just you added it to your .gitignore LOLL

I took a look at the [http-server package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and it is for node.js setup or I just went to the wrong one? haha

if you just mistaken putting your _package-lock.json_ into your .gitignore, it is not necessary to do it, instead write `node_modules*` there to just not sending all the installed modules. _package-lock.json_ is where `npm install` will go to, so leave it there.

## Overall

**Good job** and well done, the page is very closed to on board. Just some ideas on the future development of this page, I know your first job will be the navbar dropdown haha. You need a contact page for it and if possible a detail page for everyone of the products.

Honestly, it is very tired to do in pure html, js and css combination, but using framework like Vue and React, you can make the page dynamic by few lines of code.

For the product hovering part, once I put the item into my cart, the second time I hover over it, it will not let me to do the same thing again. I think you want that effect. In my opinion, you can put the `in cart` label on the `put in cart` phrase, so that users can still trigger the cart side bar open instead of go to the top and so-on and so-forth.

Second thing, for the #hero, I guess you are planning to make it a carousel, some sort of slides to show images. I think like that because your hero is too clean, usually there are customers' voice or some awards showcase, at least introduction of your company haha.

All the best Arvind~ I am willing to do another reviewing of yours.
